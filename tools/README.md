# CPM IF Tools

The tools described here aid in CPM IF-based analysis, evaluation, validation,
and general use. This directory provides an overview and description of tools
and scripts for downloading and using them.

## Integration

Tools are integrated into this repository by:
1. Adding a description of the tool to this README file, including its purpose and usage.
2. Adding a suite of commands for the tool into the `Makefile`, following a standard interface:
   - **`setup`**: Clone or initialize the tool and prepare it for use (e.g., build it).
   - **`clean`**: Remove any build artifacts or temporary files created by the tool.
   - **`test`**: Run tests to validate the tool's functionality.
   - **`run`**: Execute the tool with default or example inputs.

This ensures a consistent and systematic way to manage and use tools in this repository.

### Example Integration

For the CPM IF tool:
1. A description is added to the **Tools** section of this README.
2. The following commands are added to the `Makefile`:
   - `setup-cpm_if`: Clones the repository, builds the tool, and runs tests.
   - `clean-cpm_if`: Cleans up build artifacts for the tool.
   - `test-cpm_if`: Runs the tool's test suite.
   - `run-cpm_if`: Runs the tool with example inputs.
