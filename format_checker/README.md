# CPM Compartmentalization Interchange Format Checker

The informal IF presented in the [file](find link) is
codified in the [file](here) schema. This can be used with
the format checker through the `run.sh` script or the code
can be included in other things to validate the format on
parsing.

The run.sh script will do some management of python so that
it sets up a virtual environment and hopefully minimize
conflicts with whichever environment you choose to run this
in. You may have to ensure that pip and virtual environment
command line tools are installed.
